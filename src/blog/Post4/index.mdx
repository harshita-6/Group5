## An open letter:

<p>
  The lie goes something like this: When someone else succeeds, it means I have
  failed. This is called a “zero-sum game.” When one person wins, another person
  loses. A positive balance in someone’s ledger means a negative balance in
  mine. But, it’s a myth.
</p>
<p>
  If you’re alive and breathing, you have struggled with jealousy. It’s part of
  the human condition. So, let me say that you are not a bad person. We have all
  been there at some point. We've seen someone who makes us feel like we aren't
  enough. We let that feeling overcome us. We obsess over someone who seems
  better. When we see others who are more successful, or who have something we
  want, it’s difficult not to feel jealous. The question foremost in our minds
  is, “Why do they have ______, and I don’t?” (Fill in the blank with success,
  fame, money, or a million other things.)
</p>
<p>
  But this is the wrong question, and here’s why: It’s based on a destructive
  lie about success and everything else you desire.
</p>
<p>
  Just like every other person, I have gone through this phase too but when the
  realization hit me, I understood that there is literally no connection between
  me and the other person’s success in any field of his/her life. The invisible
  walls weren’t real. They only existed in my mind, and there was nothing—and no
  one—standing in the way of the things I desire. It’s important to realize that
  resentment and jealousy doesn't change the heart of others-- it only changes
  yours. And it’s not good now, nor will it be ever.
</p>
<p>
  The issue is that most of us are stuck in a poverty mentality- —the type of
  thinking that goes: “There’s only so much to go around. You must horde
  everything for yourself.” But it’s now time to reverse that and believe that,
  “There is more than enough to go around. Success breeds success. We can help
  each other.”
</p>
<p>
  The secret is to shift your vocabulary and begin asking the right questions in
  order to move away from a blame and victim mentality. The only way to create
  the success and change you desire is to take 100% responsibility for your
  life.
</p>
<p>
  “Why” questions keep us focused on external things we can’t control, such as
  other people’s actions and motivations. It’s much better to ask questions
  focused on “what”—what you can do, what you can control, what you can learn.
  After all, the only thing you can truly control is yourself. The sooner you
  realize it, the better.
</p>
<p>
  But to move forward in our lives, it’s necessary that we outgrew from this and
  stop drinking the poison which we think will somehow kill the other.
</p>
<p>
  When we’re jealous of someone, we begin to think of them in a negative light.
  That’s why jealousy is so insidious. At its worst, jealousy is less about
  wanting someone’s success and more about wanting their failure. So, it’s
  crucial for achieving the things we desire that we flip the scenario around
  and stay humble, put ourself in a learning posture, and start making
  discoveries that help on our own journeys.
</p>
<p>
  We all have our own paths carved in a uniquely beautiful way. So, don’t spend
  your life trying to sing someone else’s tune. Trying to copy another person’s
  success makes about as much sense as wishing you had their thumbprint and
  instead bring out your unique gift to light.
</p>
<p>
  Jealousy causes us to be inwardly focused. The more we fixate on what others
  have, the more angry, resentful, and bitter we become. So, stop focusing on
  what you don’t have, and start focusing on how you can help others. Jealousy
  is rooted in taking. Generosity is rooted in giving. I remember someone once
  said that, “Your influence is determined by how abundantly you place other
  people’s interests first”. And I can’t argue.
</p>
<p>
  The only way to defeat jealousy is by taking action. You won’t do it by
  thinking or analysing. You have to do something about it.
</p>
<p>
  Don’t forget that jealousy is an inner consciousness of one’s own inferiority.
  It is a mental cancer. And the sooner you work on to cure it, the better
  chances you’ll have to live the life you’ll remember.
</p>
<p>
  So, don’t let it overpower you. And stand up for yourself, it’s all going to
  be worth it in the end. It can look a little messy and hard when you start the
  changing process but believe me on that, that it’s going to be absolutely
  gorgeous in the end.
</p>

## What is it?

<p>
  Jealousy generally refers to the thoughts or feelings of insecurity, fear, and
  concern over a relative lack of possessions or safety. It is a typical
  experience in human relationships, and it has been observed in infants as
  young as five months. Some researchers claim that jealousy is seen in all
  cultures and is a universal trait.
</p>
<p>
  Jealousy can either be suspicious or reactive, and it is often reinforced as a
  series of particularly strong emotions and constructed as a universal human
  experience. Psychologists have proposed several models to study the processes
  underlying jealousy and have identified factors that result in jealousy.
  Sociologists have demonstrated that cultural beliefs and values play an
  important role in determining what triggers jealousy and what constitutes
  socially acceptable expressions of jealousy. Biologists have identified
  factors that may unconsciously influence the expression of jealousy like:
  <ul>
    • Anger towards a person or a situation that is interfering with something
    you care about.
  </ul>
  <ul>
    • Resenting a friend or a partner when they can’t spend enough time with you
    (even when a person realizes that they have important affairs to attend to).
  </ul>
  <ul>
    • Difficulty feeling happy for a co-worker when they receive something you
    wanted or desired.
  </ul>
  <ul>
    • Feelings of dislike toward a new person in a loved one’s life that are
    hard to explain. For example, a father might have feelings of hostility that
    stem from jealousy toward his daughter’s fiancé even if the partner she’s
    chosen is a healthy one.
  </ul>
  <ul>• Deep sadness and a hint of anger when thinking about a partner/friend/family (usually in long-term relation) with other people surrounding them.</ul>
</p>
<p>
  It is normal to feel some jealousy, but it can help to have support when
  working through strong feelings of jealousy, especially if these are rooted in
  deeper feelings related to self-esteem, trust, or control.
</p>
<p>
  There are different kind of jealousies. Some common types would be:
  <ul>
    <b>Jealousy in Relationships:</b> Mild jealousy can be healthy in
    relationships. It reiterates the fact that an individual cares about his or
    her partner, values them and does not want to lose them. Jealousy becomes
    toxic for relationships, however, if left unchecked. Trust is a key
    component of any healthy, successful relationship. Jealousy breeds
    suspicion, doubt, and mistrust, which can snowball into pretty intense
    emotions and behaviours. What began as a partnership of equals can
    degenerate into an unhappy relationship of guard and jailer. This type of
    jealousy stems from the fear of being replaced by someone else in a valued
    relationship.
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <b>Jealousy related to power and status:</b> This type of jealousy often
    occurs at a workplace or in school/colleges where the other person achieves
    the things you also want before you, may it be then promotion or better
    grades or higher rank in a competition.
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <b>Pathological jealousy:</b> It is a psychological disorder in which a
    person is preoccupied with the thought that their spouse or sexual partner
    is being unfaithful without having any real proof, along with socially
    unacceptable or abnormal behaviour related to these thoughts. The most
    common cited forms of psychopathology in morbid jealousy are delusions and
    obsessions. It is considered a subtype of delusional disorder.
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Feelings of jealousy often come from extended periods of poor communication
  and low self-esteem. People with poor boundaries might experience jealousy,
  and witnessing parents with poor boundaries usually reinforces maladaptive
  ways of coping. Because loneliness and other symptoms can manifest in
  jealousy, those with mental health issues can also be more prone.
</p>
<p>
  Children with anxious attachment styles who don’t have great emotional
  regulation skills sometimes grow up to be jealous of others; however, jealousy
  can also show up in the wake of a partner spending time with someone who feels
  like a threat, or situations where there is a new dynamic, causing trust
  issues.
</p>
<p>
  When jealous feelings are long-lasting, pervasive, or severe, it may indicate
  that the cause is an underlying mental health issue. Some mental health issues
  and symptoms associated with jealousy include:
  <ul>• Depression</ul>
  <ul>• Anxiety</ul>
  <ul>• PTSD</ul>
  <ul>• OCD</ul>
  <ul>• Attachment issues</ul>
  <ul>• Paranoia</ul>
  <ul>• Schizophrenia</ul>
  <ul>• Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)</ul>
</p>
<p>
  Jealousy can cause many complications. For example:
  <ul>• Negative impact on the relationship</ul>
  <ul>• Break up or divorce</ul>
  <ul>• Panic attacks</ul>
  <ul>• Headaches</ul>
  <ul>• Chest pain</ul>
  <ul>• High blood pressure</ul>
  <ul>• Stomach aches</ul>
  <ul>• Weight changes</ul>
  <ul>• Insomnia</ul>
</p>
<p>
  To cope up with the jealousy. Keep in mind to-
  <ul>1. Be open about your feelings</ul>
  <ul>2. Take control of your fears</ul>
  <ul>3. Discuss and set expectations</ul>
  <ul>4. Engage in gratitude and mindfulness</ul>
  <ul>5. Talk it out with a therapist</ul>
