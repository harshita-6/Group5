## An open letter:

<p>
  I know it feels like you can't control it, the overwhelming thoughts,
  feelings, and emotions that suffocate you and kill your present of all those
  small moments, moments of joy, happiness, relief, a pang of heartache, the
  comfort of your solitude, the sunrise and sunsets, the bloom of the flowers,
  the storm brewing over, everything that makes you feel human.
</p>
<p>
  But what if I tell you that you could save it, that you could savour your
  present. Because anxiety is nothing but the dizziness of freedom.
</p>
<p>
  Listen, life is a combination of happiness and pain. Pain is uncomfortable and
  is not something we usually welcome with open arms but it is inevitable but
  you know what is optional? It's suffering. We often suffer more from our
  imagined anxieties about a problem than the problem itself. And that is
  something we have to resolve.
</p>
<p>
  See, anxiety, on the whole, is not bad for you but too much of anything has
  never proved to be fruitful. Suppose you are in a jungle and you see a wolf,
  so what you would possibly do is get anxious and run in the opposite direction
  for your life, a little anxiety sometimes helps you finish your paper or
  assignments on time, it helps you meet the deadline. It pushes you forward in
  the right direction to meet your goals if you have programmed your brain in
  the right way.
</p>
<p>
  But many times, when we get anxious about things, they don't really pose
  threat to our safety or push us to achieve our set goals. Right? Because it's
  not just that we are thinking of the future, but instead we are trying to
  control it. So, you got to understand that it is not so much about controlling
  your thoughts, because that won't provide the solution you are seeking for.
  But to stand aside and watch them as they come and go and not be affected by
  it. Cause worrying is like carrying tomorrow's load with the strength we are
  given today; it is wanting to move into tomorrow ahead of time. But here's the
  deal it won't empty your future of any sorrows or pain or problems, all it
  would do is empty your today of all the possible things that could happen. So
  go easy on yourself. Know that it's okay, that you are strong to deal with
  what life throws at you. It's all about the perspective that gives you the
  strength to move forward through painful times, so broaden it.
</p>
<p>
  Next time, you are anxious focus on anything around you that is square,
  breathe in for 4 seconds, hold it in for 4 seconds, breathe out for 4 seconds
  and then hold again. Repeat it till you calm down. Talk it out, instead of
  dwelling on it. Live in the moment. Live in the breath.
</p>

## What is it?

<p>
    Anxiety is your body’s natural response to stress. 
    It’s a feeling of fear or apprehension about what’s to come. 
    The first day of school, going to a job interview,
     or giving a speech may cause most people to feel fearful and nervous.
</p>
<p>
    But if your feelings of anxiety are extreme, 
    last for longer than six months, and are interfering with your life,
     you may have an anxiety disorder. They are the most common
     form of emotional disorder and can affect anyone at any age.
</p>
<p>
    There are many types of anxiety disorders:
    <ul>
•	Panic Disorder: It causes panic attacks, which are sudden 
feelings of terror when there is no real danger. It may feel as if one is losing
 control.</ul>
 <ul>
•	Phobia: A phobia is a persistent, excessive, unrealistic 
fear of an object, person, animal, activity or situation. A person 
with a phobia either tries to avoid the thing that triggers the fear,
 or endures it with great anxiety and distress. Some phobias are very specific 
 and limited.</ul><ul>
•	Social Anxiety Disorder: For people with social anxiety disorder,
 everyday social interactions cause irrational anxiety, fear, 
 self-consciousness and embarrassment. Symptoms may include excessive 
 fear of situations in which one may be judged, worry about embarrassment 
 or humiliation or concern about offending someone.</ul><ul>
•	Obsessive Compulsive Disorder: This disorder 
features a pattern of unwanted thoughts and fears (obsessions) that 
lead you to do repetitive behaviours (compulsions). These obsessions and 
compulsions interfere with daily activities and cause significant distress.</ul><ul>
•	Separation Anxiety Disorder: This disorder is a condition in which 
a child becomes fearful and nervous when away from home or separated 
from a loved one- usually a parent or other caregiver- to whom the 
child is attached.</ul><ul>
•	Illness Anxiety Disorder: It is sometimes 
called hypochondriasis or health anxiety, is worrying 
excessively that you are or may become seriously ill. 
You may have no physical symptoms.</ul><ul>
•	Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: It is a mental 
health condition that's triggered by a terrifying
 event — either experiencing it or witnessing it. 
 Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares and severe
  anxiety, as well as uncontrollable thoughts about the event.</ul><ul>
•	Agoraphobia: It is a type of anxiety
 disorder in which you fear and avoid places or
  situations that might cause you to panic and make you feel 
  trapped, helpless or embarrassed. You fear an actual or anticipated situation,
   such as using public transportation, being in open or enclosed spaces,
    standing in line, or being in a crowd.</ul>

</p>
<p>
    Anxiety feels different for every other people ranging 
    from butterflies in your stomach, rapid breathing, a racing
     heart to experiencing nightmares, panic attacks, trouble concentrating, 
     difficulty falling asleep and painful thoughts or memories that you can’t control. 
     You may have a general feeling of fear and worry, or you may fear a specific
      place or event.
     It is important that you know all the ways anxiety can present itself.
</p>
<p>
    Researchers are not exactly sure of on what brings anxiety disorder.
     Many factors play a role in this. Some of them could be:
     <ul>
         •	Genetics: Anxiety disorder can run in families.
     </ul>
     <ul>
•	Brain chemistry: Some research suggests anxiety disorders may
 be linked to faulty circuits in the brain that control fear and emotions.
     </ul>
      <ul>
         •	Substance Abuse: Their use often worsens the case of anxiety disorder.
     </ul>
      <ul>
         •	Medical conditions: Some heart, lung, and thyroid conditions can cause symptoms
          similar to anxiety disorders or make anxiety symptoms worse.
     </ul>
      <ul>
         •	Childhood sexual abuse: Often abuse like physical,
          emotional or sexual abuse during childhood is linked to anxiety disorder later in life.
     </ul>
      <ul>
         •	Trauma: Living through a traumatic 
         event increases the risk of PTSD which can cause panic attacks.
     </ul>
      <ul>
         •	Low self-esteem: Negative perceptions about yourself
          also leads to social anxiety disorder. 
     </ul>
 
</p>
<p>
    A good way to cope up with anxiety is to bring change in your lifestyle.
     Some of those changes could be:
     <ul>
         •	Meditation
     </ul>
     <ul>
         •	Journaling
              </ul>
    <ul>
        •	Physical exercise
    </ul>
    <ul>
        •	Eating healthy
    </ul>
    <ul>
        •	Getting enough sleep
    </ul>
    <ul>
             •	Always hydrating
    </ul>
     <ul>
        •	Quit alcohol/ drug
    </ul>
     <ul>
        •	Reduce caffeine intake
    </ul>

</p>
<p>
    Some foods like dark chocolate and chamomile tea can also help with your anxiety.
</p>
<p>
    Psychotherapy is also used to help with anxiety disorders. 
    It is a collaborative process, where psychologists and patients 
    work together to identify specific concerns and develop concrete
     skills and techniques for coping with anxiety. A form of psychotherapy 
     also known as cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is highly effective at
      treating anxiety disorders. Through CBT, psychologists help patients learn to
     identify and manage the factors that contribute to their anxiety.
</p>
<p>
    Anxiety disorders can be treated with medication, psychotherapy,
     or a combination of the two. Some people who have a mild anxiety disorder, 
     or a fear of something they can easily avoid,
     decide to live with the condition and to not seek treatment.
</p>
<p>
    It’s important to understand 
    that anxiety disorders can be treated, even in severe cases.
</p>
<p>
    Live a happy healthy life!!!!
