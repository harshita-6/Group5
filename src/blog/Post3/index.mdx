## An open letter:

<p>
  Guilt- it's perhaps the most painful emotion that you feel and it's the worst
  of all the demons. It's a feeling of remorse for some wrong whether real or
  imagined that you did to someone.
</p>
<p>
  But holding on to things that have gone wrong in your past is not going to
  serve your future. Because what you are doing is that you are letting that
  moment from your past, the moment that no longer exists suck out all the joy
  out of your present and your future. Is it worth it to you? Are you really up
  for that "already over" moment to take away all the joy from your next
  moments?
</p>
<p>
  Let it go. We all make mistakes. We all do. But guilt is just a useless
  feeling. It's never enough to make you change your direction instead it'll
  just make you like itself.
</p>
<p>
  Maybe there's more you could have done at that time to better the
  circumstances but it's over. It's no longer in your grasp to change that
  moment but what you can still do is own it, confront it, and learn from it.
  Don't let it strangle you anymore. Because when you are guilty, it is always
  followed by you feeling shame for what you are. And that's where the downfall
  begins because it tears a person in the worst way because where guilt would
  have motivated a confession but the wish to avoid the humiliation of shame may
  just prevent it.
</p>
<p>
  So, the best way to begin would be by being honest about your feelings and
  realizing that guilt is detrimental to your happiness and just a wasted
  emotion. So, do the right thing and go and apologize. Forgive yourself. Make
  amends and then let go of it. Cause if you don't do that now, it will lead you
  to only one place and that is fear. And darling, fear holds back way too much
  of life.
</p>
<p>
  So now it's your choice to make, either you can allow guilt to hold you back
  or you can allow it to show you what you need to shift in your life in order
  for you to breathe free again.
</p>
<p>
  <b>
    Remember, you are not your past. And start with one day at a time. Be kind
    to yourself.

## What is it?

<p>
  Guilt is difficult to pin down, but we all feel it. You may feel guilty for a
  thought you’ve had or something you’ve done. You may also feel guilty that
  your thoughts and actions don’t coincide with your culture, your family, or
  your beliefs. While your associations with guilt may be negative, it does have
  a positive function.
</p>
<p>
  Oftentimes, guilt is meant to help you make a morally upright decision. If
  your deeds provoke negative outcomes or emotions, guilt will later inform you
  that it was the wrong thing to do, and doing it again will make you feel
  guilty. You will often see guilt and shame in the same conversation because
  they help you make moral decisions.
</p>
<p>
  Excessive guilt, however, is when guilt turns sour. It can lead to anxious
  obsessions, depressive tendencies, and physical symptoms if it’s not
  addressed. While most guilt is internal, it is often conditioned by external
  factors — which means with the right habits, it can be unlearned. To unlearn
  excessive guilt, you must know the signs.
</p>
<p>
  Guilt is intertwined with other disorders, and separating them can be a
  challenge. Understanding guilt’s role in disorders like obsessive-compulsive
  disorder ( OCD) and depression, along with its physical symptoms, can help you
  notice its signs and learn how to overcome excessive guilt.
</p>
<p>
  There are a number of different factors that can contribute to a guilt complex. Some of these include:
<ul>
● Anxiety: If you have a great deal of anxiety, you may be more likely 
to negatively assess your own actions in ways that lead to feelings of guilt.</ul><ul>
● Childhood experiences: Children who are raised in households where they are made 
to feel that they have done something wrong, have something to hide, or are
 responsible for problems may be left with lingering feelings of guilt.</ul><ul>
● Culture: If you find yourself doing things that are in opposition to 
the cultural norms you were raised with, you may experience guilt even if 
you no longer believe in or support those norms.</ul><ul>
● Religion: Some religious traditions rely on feelings of guilt as a way to 
indicate that a person has done something wrong.</ul><ul>
 ●Social pressure: If you feel that other people are judging you for the things 
that you have done, you may be left with feelings of guilt and remorse.</ul>

</p>
<p>
  Research connecting guilt and psychology doesn’t always agree. Some studies have found that guilt may help protect people from emotional distress. Others suggest guilt, especially 
  excessive guilt, contributes to emotional and mental distress.
</p>
<p>
  In general, there are three different types of guilt.
<ul>
● Reactive guilt: Reactive guilt happens when a person believes they have acted against either their own personal beliefs of what is morally good or the standards society has for acceptable behavior.</ul><ul>
● Anticipatory guilt: This guilt is the result of thinking about acting against personal moral standards or the standards of society. A person may choose not to take a certain action because they know it is wrong or believe it may hurt others.</ul><ul>
● Existential guilt: This guilt can be more complicated. Existential guilt can describe a person’s feelings for general injustice, or the idea that “Life isn’t fair.” It can also describe the guilt a person feels for the negative impact they may have on the lives of others.</ul>
Some researchers further divide guilt into two categories. These categories can be considered separately from the above types of guilt.
<ul>
● Maladaptive guilt: This kind of guilt often has a negative impact on life. This guilt might include chronic guilt (guilt that relates to shame) and other guilt that leads to mental or emotional distress.</ul><ul>
● Adaptive or pro-social guilt: This kind of guilt is believed to be helpful, as it relates to a person’s understanding of wrongdoing and responsibility.</ul>
</p>
<p>
  How to forgive yourself when you’ve done something wrong: Forgiving yourself after offending someone or doing them wrong takes self-reflection and commitment to make changes.
<ul>
● Accept and admit to yourself what you did wrong.</ul><ul>
● Acknowledge that you regret your decision and wish you had acted differently.</ul><ul>
● Consider why you made the mistake. Were you tired, jealous, desperate, angry, etc.?</ul><ul>
● Ask yourself how you wish you had handled the situation differently and commit to responding to similar situations differently in the future.</ul><ul>
● Try to make amends with the people you hurt. This may not always be possible if they are not willing to cooperate – all you can do is your part. Offer a genuine and sincere apology without defending yourself, accept responsibility and do what is reasonable to make it right.</ul><ul>
● Make peace with yourself. Choosing to hold onto your guilt forever will only make a bad situation worse over time. Think about the mistake long enough to learn from it, but move past it.</ul>
</p>
<p>
  It is important to get help in order to protect your mental well-being and quality of life. If you are experiencing symptoms of guilt that are interfering with your daily life and causing distress, talk to your doctor or a mental health professional. There are different 
  treatment options that may help you cope with a guilt complex.
</p>
<p>
  Medications Your doctor may prescribe antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications to help you cope with symptoms of depression or anxiety, but they may also recommend psychotherapy. Talk to Someone Sharing your feelings with a close friend can sometimes be helpful. Social support can play a pivotal role in coping with difficult emotions, so maintaining your 
  relationships with friends and loved ones is important.
</p>
<p>
  If you struggle to talk to your loved ones about your feelings of guilt or if they are not providing the type of support you need, discussing your feelings with a mental health professional can also be helpful. Traditional face-to-face therapy sessions are one option, but online therapy may also be a convenient option that you might want to consider.It is when these feelings become persistent and overwhelming that it is important to seek professional help. Talk to your doctor or a mental health professional if you are experiencing symptoms of excessive
   guilt or other symptoms of depression.
