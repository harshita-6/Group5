            Our motive is to build a community which is strong and real. A
            community where they ask the questions like, “What matters to you?”
            instead of, “What is the matter with you?”. The website and the team
            would always stand with the user when they hit a stumble and
            throughout this beautiful journey that life is.{" "}

            This website aims to broaden the perspective of user on certain
            topics and provide the safe space for them where they can be
            themselves and indulge in their personal growth so that they can
            leave harmful coping mechanisms of theirs behind and move on with
            their true real identity.

            There are 4 main sections to this website starting with providing
            the user with all range of helpline numbers in just one place. A lot
            could be changed and saved with just a dial. People sometimes tend
            to forget that the solution is available for their problems only if
            they are courageous enough to look for them. So, this website lays
            out this option for them.

            Leading this section is our vent box where the user can anonymously
            spit out their ordeal. We understand that it’s not always easy to
            open up and share everything to the people we surround ourselves
            with. But talking about your situation out openly can feel
            liberating and help release the burden to some extent. So, we
            provide the service of vent box in the hope of this.

            Third feature of this website is named, “Words to remember”.
            Sometimes what a person needs is quick and timely burst of wisdom to
            get the focus back. So, our idea is similar to that of post-it notes
            that would keep reminding our user of their significance and
            importance in this world. To tell them that, “You matter!!”, to
            remind them the truths of life.

          >
            Last section is named, “Life Happens”. And true to its name life
            happens and it’s always not so pleasant. And when that hits, this
            feature of the website presents you with an open letter written just
            for the emotion you are feeling at the point in hope to make it
            better along with the links of ted talks regarding that. With users
            who are unable to understand and grasp a certain topic mentioned in
            this section have nothing to worry about. Because it’s not just the
            open letter that we have provided but what it actually is, is also
            stated.
